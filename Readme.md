Deploy and test

Set up your Firebase project:
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Register your app with Firebase
3. Enable Google Provider in the Auth section
4. Clone or download this repo and open the directory.
5. You must have the Firebase CLI installed. If you don't have it install it with 'npm install -g firebase-tools' and then configure it with 'firebase login'.
6. Install dependencies locally by running: 'cd functions;' 'npm install;' 'cd -'
7. Deploy your project using 'firebase deploy'
